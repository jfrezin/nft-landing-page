        <h2>About</br>XLence and PinUpXL</h2>
               
        <p>XLence was born out of PinUpXL, which I started in 2017 before I knew the word NFT. Back then, the original idea of PinUpXL was to create A collection (art series) of fictional advertisements inspired by my love for Pin-Up art, funny ads and curvy women. The original series, which can be <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/jfrez-collection" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a>, was inspired by Spencer David's Booty Babe Art and the voluptuous beauties found in Phil Henderson's art.</p><br>
          <p>This XLence series signifies the resurrection of my PinUpXL brand. We're starting with these bust images featuring only upper-body, but the goal is to create full body images.</p><br>
          <p>Unlike many projects that are using their profits to fund worthy causes, like charity, there's no such plan for this project. In the future, hopefully we'll donate a portion to organizations that help with women's body image issues (I'm very open to suggestions). As for now, the main point of the project is to help me get to a financial position where I can devote myself full-time to working on projects that I'm passionate about, like this one. If you'd like to come with me on this journey, then consider buying an XLence. I have big plans for this series and I can't wait to see them in your hands. Check out the road map. It's different then other projects because it's more long-term than short-term. But I'm excited and I've been thinking of doing these for at least half a decade.</p>

        <h2>Road Map</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center; color: pink">This list may change according to community needs.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Create full-body sequel to XLence that somewhat resembles the original series in terms of themes and compositions. I've been thinking more of a 3d implementation to give them more flexibility for adaptation in future projects by me or you. I have plans that I can't even speak of yet because I feel like they're too out there... baby-steps, right?</li>
          <li>Create and publish the fictional book series based of the PinUpXL line. The setting and theme of the book has already been created. It's just a matter of bringing it to life. If you want to have more confidence in my story-telling, then check out my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparo-Unlucky-Ones-M-J-Frezin-ebook/dp/B07ZZDQ6J9 ">Sparo: The Unlucky Ones</a>. Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to make the book beneficial to owners of XLence and related PinUpXL projects (I'm also open to suggestions on that).</li>
          <li>Create an exclusive line of dolls, action figures, or statues that only owners can purchase.</li>
